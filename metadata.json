  "Description": "The Morgan Fingerprints, or extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) are one of the most widely used molecular representations. They are circular representations (from an atom, search the atoms around with a radius n) and can have thousands of features. This implementation uses the RDKit package and is done with radius 3 and 2048 dimensions.\n",
